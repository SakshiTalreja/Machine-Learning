# ML Algorithm Identifier for Regression

Finding the best suitable ML algorithm for any dataset is one of 
the needs of developers. So I made this small project, to find 
out the best-fit algorithm for any regression-based data. Data 
pre-processing is done in the beginning and data visualization 
using different graphs. Here I also proved that increasing the 
size of data does not always increase the accuracy of the model, 
it sometimes decreases.
Here you can try any dataset(examples are uploaded) but it should be based on regression.
